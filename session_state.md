## Active Thread: Critical Comparison and Differentiation

### What Happened This Session

1. HEAD 015 crystallized earlier (retrieval as grounding)
2. Project prompt v2 deployed
3. Persona seed captured
4. Document lifecycle discussion
5. **HEAD 016 crystallized: Lattice as Semantic Space with Projective Views**
6. **Lattice Product Concept View synthesized** — comprehensive snapshot of current understanding across all 16 HEADs
7. **Deep research into competing approaches** — GraphRAG, RAPTOR, traditional KGs, LLM-constructed graphs, agent memory systems
8. **Critical comparison analysis produced** — honest assessment of differentiation, risks, strategic focus
9. **HEAD 017 pending** — Differentiation and strategic focus

## HEAD 016 Core Insight

The lattice isn't layers but a **navigable semantic space** where HEADs and sources coexist. Views are projections for different purposes.

## Critical Comparison Findings (Major Work This Session)

### Where Lattice Genuinely Differs

1. **Contestation as first-class** — `:contested_by` preserves disagreement. Others smooth it over.
2. **Provenance as constitutive** — `:grounded_in` is load-bearing, not metadata.
3. **Temporal model** — Content frozen, structure evolves (Talmudic).
4. **Two-phase retrieval** — Navigate at HEAD, ground at source.
5. **Human crystallization** — Understanding through dialogue, not extraction.

### Honest Risks Identified

- **No automation = no scale** — Manual crystallization bottleneck
- **Grounding constraint may be too strong** — What counts as grounding?
- **No forgetting** — Unbounded growth
- **Theory-implementation gap** — Rich theory, thin implementation
- **Unvalidated claims** — Contestation helps? Two-phase beats flat? Unproven.

### Strategic Focus Recommended

**Prioritize:**
- Contestation mechanics (clearest differentiator)
- Ghost detection / grounding verification
- Personal knowledge assistant use case
- Comparative benchmarking vs GraphRAG/RAPTOR

**De-prioritize:**
- View rendering, aspect taxonomy, full doc lifecycle

**Investigate:**
- Semi-automatic crystallization
- Forgetting mechanisms
- Grounding metrics

### The Honest Value Proposition

> The Lattice is a personal semantic memory for extended thinking with AI, where understanding emerges through dialogue, disagreement is preserved, and knowledge maintains connection to its sources.

Requires human investment. Not automated knowledge management—augmented thinking.

## Documents Produced This Session

1. **Lattice_Product_Concept_View_Dec2025.md** — Synthesis of current understanding
2. **Lattice_Critical_Comparison_Dec2025.md** — Competitive analysis & strategic focus

Both uploaded to project files.

## Seeds

### Seed 1: Persona as Counter-Mimicry
LLMs mimic domain/register. Persona provides stable orientation. Taylor's "Strong Evaluator" = deep frameworks grounding identity. (From earlier session)

---

## Lattice State
- **16 HEADs crystallized** (001-016)
- **HEAD 017 pending** — Differentiation analysis
- **1 seed** awaiting crystallization (persona)

## For Next Session
- Crystallize HEAD 017 if compaction interrupted
- Consider strategic priorities from comparison
- Begin implementation of prioritized features?
- Comparative benchmarking design?
