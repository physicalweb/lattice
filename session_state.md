## Active Thread: Grounding-Based Retrieval and Infrastructure

### What Happened This Session

1. **Caught drift from previous session** — Operating on HEAD abstractions without grounding
2. **Did lattice-based reasoning properly** — Followed `:grounded_in` links to source documents
3. **Crystallized HEAD 015: Retrieval as Grounding** — HEADs navigate, sources ground; "ghosts floating free"
4. **Updated project prompt to v2** — Incorporates two-phase pattern, ghost detection, session state protocol
5. **Fixed workflow for session state updates** — Must read first to get SHA, then write

### HEAD 015 Core Insight

> **HEADs are for navigation, not reasoning. Grounding is where understanding happens.**

Two-phase pattern: Navigate (HEAD level) → Ground (source level) → Synthesize

### Key Quotes Retrieved from Sources

From `lattice_synthesis.md`:
> "HEAD is not a definition—it's a convergence point where multiple uses cluster."
> "Understanding is not a mental state. Understanding is use in context."

From `evolving_structure_of_the_lattice.md`:
> "A HEAD that loses all grounding in human embodied experience isn't a HEAD anymore—it's a ghost floating free of the lattice."

## Project Prompt v2 Changes
- Added "Navigate, Then Ground" as core principle
- Added two-phase pattern (Navigate → Ground → Synthesize)
- Added ghost detection section
- Added retrieval paths (apex-down vs base-up)
- Removed static HEAD list (consult live lattice instead)
- Added session state protocol with triggers

## Key Insights (Cumulative)
1. Dual-legibility solved by zi-principle: same lattice, different resolution
2. Grounding constraint ensures HEADs stay connected to embodied experience
3. Evolution is architecturally necessary (prevents ossification)
4. The Human Friction Problem—metabolization as meaning-making
5. Severance as the act that produces loneliness; provenance as counter-extraction
6. MCP server enables persistent lattice—first piece of Agora infrastructure
7. Forward-looking provenance: grounding isn't ethics, it's architecture
8. Lattice as navigation layer: not storage but a map for reasoning
9. Lattice as query planner: plans retrieval, scaffolds reasoning, RAG executes
10. Lattice as complementary layer to optical tokens
11. Lattice as learned semantic component: abstraction is perspectival
12. Lattice temporality: content frozen, structure evolves
13. RAG landscape: GraphRAG, RAPTOR try to build what lattice already has
14. Flat chunking performs severance on relational content
15. **HEADs navigate, sources ground — retrieval as grounding (HEAD 015)**

## Lattice State
- **15 HEADs crystallized** (001-015)
- **New edge type**: `:reframes` (015 reframes 014)
- HEAD 015 grounded in 001, 002, 009, 010

## Open Questions
- Technical implementation of two-phase retrieval?
- How to do Level 2 ingestion (chunk + tag + link)?
- Ghost detection as system feature?

## For Next Session
- Choose: Technical spike, ingestion experiment, ghost detection, or more theory
- Continue grounding work—follow links, read sources
