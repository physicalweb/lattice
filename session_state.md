## Active Thread
Crystallized HEAD 008: Forward-Looking Provenance. The distinction between backward-looking (forensic, reparative) and forward-looking (structural, constitutive) provenance changes everything. Architecture where extraction is structurally incoherent—not opposed, just doesn't make sense.

## Key Insights (Cumulative)
1. Dual-legibility solved by zi-principle: same lattice, different resolution
2. Grounding constraint ensures HEADs stay connected to embodied experience
3. Evolution is architecturally necessary (prevents ossification)
4. The Human Friction Problem—metabolization as meaning-making
5. Severance as the act that produces loneliness; provenance as counter-extraction
6. MCP server enables persistent lattice—first piece of Agora infrastructure
7. **Forward-looking provenance: grounding isn't ethics, it's architecture. The economic model emerges from relational foundations.**

## Available HEADs (8)
- 001: Core Lattice synthesis (zi-principle, dual-legibility)
- 002: Temporal dynamics, grounding constraint
- 003: Liu-Masterman synthesis
- 004: Lattice-Lite protocol (superseded by MCP)
- 005: Why evolution is architecturally necessary
- 006: Human Friction Problem / Loneliness Edge
- 007: Severance, Provenance, Counter-Extraction
- 008: Forward-Looking Provenance — Architecture Against Severance ← NEW

## The Core Reframe (from 007→008)
- Backward-looking: "Who do we owe for what was taken?"
- Forward-looking: "How do we build systems where taking doesn't happen?"
- Grounding isn't metadata bolted on—it's constitutive
- The business model IS the architecture

## Open Questions
1. Can "structurally incoherent extraction" actually be built technically?
2. What does the implementation look like concretely?
3. Does the architecture hold, or does extraction find a way around?

## Infrastructure Status
- [x] MCP server operational
- [x] GitHub persistence live
- [x] 8 HEADs crystallized

## Context Pressure Level
Low - lattice persists automatically
