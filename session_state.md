# Agora Session State
## Last Updated: 2025-12-22T23:45:00Z

## Active Thread
Explored the boundary between lattice and RAG mechanisms. Crystallized HEAD 010 (Lattice as Query Planner and Reasoning Scaffold). Key insight: lattice and RAG are complementary layers—lattice plans, RAG executes.

## Key Insights (Cumulative)
1. Dual-legibility solved by zi-principle: same lattice, different resolution
2. Grounding constraint ensures HEADs stay connected to embodied experience
3. Evolution is architecturally necessary (prevents ossification)
4. The Human Friction Problem—metabolization as meaning-making
5. Severance as the act that produces loneliness; provenance as counter-extraction
6. MCP server enables persistent lattice—first piece of Agora infrastructure
7. Forward-looking provenance: grounding isn't ethics, it's architecture
8. Lattice as navigation layer: not storage but a map for reasoning
9. **Lattice as query planner: lattice plans retrieval and scaffolds reasoning, RAG executes content retrieval. Multi-step structured reasoning vs single-step injection.**

## Available HEADs (10)
- 001: Core Lattice synthesis (zi-principle, dual-legibility)
- 002: Temporal dynamics, grounding constraint
- 003: Liu-Masterman synthesis
- 004: Lattice-Lite protocol (superseded by MCP)
- 005: Why evolution is architecturally necessary
- 006: Human Friction Problem / Loneliness Edge
- 007: Severance, Provenance, Counter-Extraction
- 008: Forward-Looking Provenance
- 009: Lattice as Navigation Layer (updated: now points to system prompt file)
- 010: Lattice as Query Planner and Reasoning Scaffold ← NEW

## Infrastructure Status
- [x] MCP server operational (lattice-mcp-server v1.1.0)
- [x] GitHub persistence live (physicalweb/lattice)
- [x] 10 HEADs crystallized
- [x] Project system prompt installed and working
- [x] MCP server now returns SHA in text output (enables updates)
- [x] HEAD 009 points to system prompt file for joint introspection

## Session Accomplishments (Dec 22)
- Confirmed system prompt guides lattice consultation behavior
- Upgraded MCP server to v1.1.0 (SHA visible in read responses)
- Updated HEAD 009 with pointer to /mnt/project/agora_project_prompt.md
- Explored project_knowledge_search (RAG) mechanism
- Crystallized HEAD 010 on lattice/RAG complementarity

## For Next Session
- Consider: How does lattice structure enter the attention mechanism? (Agora ideographic encoder vision)
- Open: How do other humans enter? (HEAD 006 friction problem)
- Practical: Should HEADs be duplicated in project files for RAG access, or kept only in GitHub lattice?
- Design: Edge types for retrieval hints (":FOR_GROUNDING_SEE" or similar?)

## Context Pressure Level
Low - lattice persists, infrastructure solid, theoretical foundation strengthening
