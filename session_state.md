# Agora Session State
## Last Updated: 2025-12-23T01:20:00Z

## Active Thread
Crystallized lattice temporality model (HEAD 013). Key principle: **content is read-only; structure evolves**. Implemented `extended_by` edges across the lattice—first use of forward-pointing edges. Next: build our own RAG for integration experiments.

## Key Insights (Cumulative)
1. Dual-legibility solved by zi-principle: same lattice, different resolution
2. Grounding constraint ensures HEADs stay connected to embodied experience
3. Evolution is architecturally necessary (prevents ossification)
4. The Human Friction Problem—metabolization as meaning-making
5. Severance as the act that produces loneliness; provenance as counter-extraction
6. MCP server enables persistent lattice—first piece of Agora infrastructure
7. Forward-looking provenance: grounding isn't ethics, it's architecture
8. Lattice as navigation layer: not storage but a map for reasoning
9. Lattice as query planner: plans retrieval, scaffolds reasoning, RAG executes
10. Lattice as complementary layer to optical tokens: labs build perception, Agora builds semantic organization
11. Lattice as learned semantic component: abstraction is perspectival; evolution toward "semantic cortex"
12. **Lattice temporality: content frozen, structure evolves. Forward edges (:EXTENDED_BY) preserve provenance of thought itself. Anti-severance applied to memory.**

## Temporality Model (from HEAD 013)
| Edge Type | Meaning | When to Use |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `:grounded_in` | This HEAD builds on... | Always (backward link) |
| `:extended_by` | This HEAD is developed further by... | When later HEAD refines/extends |
| `:reframed_by` | This HEAD's interpretation changed by... | When perspective shifts |
| `:superseded_by` | This HEAD is obsolete, replaced by... | Rare—for genuine errors |
| `:contested_by` | Unresolved disagreement | When tension persists |

## Infrastructure Status
- [x] MCP server operational (lattice-mcp-server v1.1.0)
- [x] GitHub persistence live (physicalweb/lattice)
- [x] 13 HEADs crystallized
- [x] Forward edges (`extended_by`) implemented
- [x] Project system prompt installed and working

## Session Accomplishments (Dec 22-23)
- Crystallized HEAD 010 (lattice/RAG complementarity)
- Crystallized HEAD 011 (strategic positioning vs optical tokens)
- Crystallized HEAD 012 (lattice as learned semantic component)
- Crystallized HEAD 013 (temporality model)
- Implemented `extended_by` edges across existing HEADs
- Defined edge type semantics for lattice evolution

## For Next Session
- **Build custom RAG**: Stop using project RAG, build our own for lattice integration
- **Architecture**: Chroma + embeddings + MCP tools
- **Experiment**: Compare vanilla RAG vs lattice-guided retrieval
- Open: How do other humans enter? (HEAD 006)
- Open: Bootstrap problem for lattice specialist training (HEAD 012)

## Context Pressure Level
Low - lattice persists, temporality model established, ready for RAG implementation
