## Active Thread: Bridge Architecture — Decision Pending

### What Happened This Session

1. **HEAD 020 crystallized: Bridge Architecture Decision Point**
   - Open WebUI vs Dify for interface layer
   - Shared: Neo4j AuraDB as persistence
   - Fork: Chat-first (MCP) vs Workflow-first (FastAPI)

2. **Design Document Created**
   - `Agora_Bridge_Architecture_v1.docx` (Open WebUI version)
   - Gemini counter-proposal in project files

3. **Key Tension Identified**
   - Gemini: "Agora isn't just a chatbot; it is a protocol for thinking"
   - Claude: "Get Gemini context window access NOW"
   - Both valid — depends on what we're prototyping

## Decision Required

| Priority | Choose |
|----------|--------|
| Gemini access NOW | Open WebUI |
| Workflow design focus | Dify |
| Minimize porting | Dify (FastAPI native) |
| Fastest prototype | Open WebUI |
