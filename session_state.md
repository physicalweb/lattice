## Active Thread: Research Consolidation Complete

### What Happened This Session

1. **HEAD 019 crystallized and updated: Technical Stack Blueprint**
   - Gemini Deep Research analysis synthesized
   - ChatGPT research folded in (MCP survey + NotebookLM ecosystem)
   - Multi-model convergence documented

2. **Key Findings Consolidated**
   - HippoRAG PPR as Layer 2 navigation (Gemini)
   - Per-claim citation granularity (ChatGPT)
   - "AI structure as starting point" for human crystallization (ChatGPT)
   - Build *with* vs build *around* (ChatGPT)
   - Industry bifurcation: Consensus vs Contestation (all models)

3. **Multi-Model Convergence Confirmed**
   - All three models (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT) independently validated:
     - Contestation as differentiator
     - Neo4j for graph storage
     - Orchestration patterns (NCP, 1MCPServer, Archestra)
     - Human crystallization as central
     - Provenance as architectural

## Lattice State

- **19 HEADs crystallized** (001-019)
- HEAD 019 is comprehensive technical stack blueprint
- Research phase complete; ready for implementation planning

## Concrete Stack Summary (HEAD 019)

| Layer | Primary | Alternatives |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| 3 (Router) | NCP | 1MCPServer, Archestra |
| 2 (Graph) | Neo4j | Basic Memory |
| 2 (Navigation) | HippoRAG PPR | — |
| 1 (Vector) | Zilliz | Chroma, Needle |
| 1 (Structure) | RAPTOR | — |
| 1 (Provenance) | Zotero | OneCite, OpenMetadata |

## For Next Session

- Implementation prioritization
- Minimum viable prototype scope
- Consider: NCP + Neo4j + simple PPR as Phase 0
- Per-claim citation model design
- API-first architecture decisions
