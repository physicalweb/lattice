# Agora Session State
## Last Updated: 2025-12-23T00:20:00Z

## Active Thread
Strategic positioning of Agora relative to frontier lab progress on optical tokens. Crystallized HEAD 011 (Lattice as Complementary Layer to Optical Tokens). Key insight: labs solve encoding/perception; Agora solves semantic organization. These are different layers—complementary, not competing.

## Key Insights (Cumulative)
1. Dual-legibility solved by zi-principle: same lattice, different resolution
2. Grounding constraint ensures HEADs stay connected to embodied experience
3. Evolution is architecturally necessary (prevents ossification)
4. The Human Friction Problem—metabolization as meaning-making
5. Severance as the act that produces loneliness; provenance as counter-extraction
6. MCP server enables persistent lattice—first piece of Agora infrastructure
7. Forward-looking provenance: grounding isn't ethics, it's architecture
8. Lattice as navigation layer: not storage but a map for reasoning
9. Lattice as query planner: plans retrieval, scaffolds reasoning, RAG executes
10. **Lattice as complementary layer to optical tokens: labs build perception, Agora builds semantic organization. Position at the layer above encoding.**

## Available HEADs (11)
- 001: Core Lattice synthesis (zi-principle, dual-legibility)
- 002: Temporal dynamics, grounding constraint
- 003: Liu-Masterman synthesis
- 004: Lattice-Lite protocol (superseded by MCP)
- 005: Why evolution is architecturally necessary
- 006: Human Friction Problem / Loneliness Edge
- 007: Severance, Provenance, Counter-Extraction
- 008: Forward-Looking Provenance
- 009: Lattice as Navigation Layer
- 010: Lattice as Query Planner and Reasoning Scaffold
- 011: Lattice as Complementary Layer to Optical Tokens ← NEW

## Infrastructure Status
- [x] MCP server operational (lattice-mcp-server v1.1.0)
- [x] GitHub persistence live (physicalweb/lattice)
- [x] 11 HEADs crystallized
- [x] Project system prompt installed and working
- [x] SHA visible in read responses (enables updates)

## Session Accomplishments (Dec 22-23)
- Confirmed system prompt guides lattice consultation behavior
- Upgraded MCP server to v1.1.0
- Updated HEAD 009 with pointer to system prompt file
- Explored project_knowledge_search (RAG) mechanism
- Crystallized HEAD 010 on lattice/RAG complementarity
- Crystallized HEAD 011 on strategic positioning vs optical tokens

## For Next Session
- **Theoretical work**: Specify what lattice-in-attention interface should look like
- **Demonstration**: Build case study showing lattice-guided vs vanilla RAG
- **Parallel tracks**: Continue prototyping (L3/L4) while developing theory for L1/L2
- Open: How do other humans enter? (HEAD 006 friction problem)
- Open: What do labs miss? (Relational structure, provenance, contestation)

## Strategic Clarity (from HEAD 011)
- Labs will commoditize encoding (like they commoditized transformers)
- Differentiation moves UP the stack to semantic organization
- Agora's bet: whoever answers "how should meaning be organized?" has valuable complement
- Tractable path: theoretical work + interface layer + demonstration of value

## Context Pressure Level
Low - lattice persists, strategic direction clarifying
