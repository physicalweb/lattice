# Agora Session State
## Last Updated: 2025-12-23T00:50:00Z

## Active Thread
Explored the deeper nature of the lattice: perspectival abstraction, attention topology, and evolution toward a learned semantic component. Crystallized HEAD 012 (Lattice as Learned Semantic Component). Key insight: the lattice evolves from static index to "semantic cortex"—a specialized organ for relational meaning.

## Key Insights (Cumulative)
1. Dual-legibility solved by zi-principle: same lattice, different resolution
2. Grounding constraint ensures HEADs stay connected to embodied experience
3. Evolution is architecturally necessary (prevents ossification)
4. The Human Friction Problem—metabolization as meaning-making
5. Severance as the act that produces loneliness; provenance as counter-extraction
6. MCP server enables persistent lattice—first piece of Agora infrastructure
7. Forward-looking provenance: grounding isn't ethics, it's architecture
8. Lattice as navigation layer: not storage but a map for reasoning
9. Lattice as query planner: plans retrieval, scaffolds reasoning, RAG executes
10. Lattice as complementary layer to optical tokens: labs build perception, Agora builds semantic organization
11. **Lattice as learned semantic component: abstraction is perspectival; lattice could shape attention gradients; evolution from static index → query planner → specialized ML component → attention topology**

## Lattice Evolution Path (from HEAD 012)
| Stage | What Lattice Is | Status |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| Static index | Hand-crystallized HEADs | Current |
| Query planner | Retrieval guide, reasoning scaffold | HEAD 010 |
| Learned component | Small specialized model | Theoretical |
| Attention topology | Shapes gradient memory | Long-term vision |

## Infrastructure Status
- [x] MCP server operational (lattice-mcp-server v1.1.0)
- [x] GitHub persistence live (physicalweb/lattice)
- [x] 12 HEADs crystallized
- [x] Project system prompt installed and working
- [x] SHA visible in read responses (enables updates)

## Session Accomplishments (Dec 22-23)
- Upgraded MCP server to v1.1.0
- Crystallized HEAD 010 (lattice/RAG complementarity)
- Crystallized HEAD 011 (strategic positioning vs optical tokens)
- Crystallized HEAD 012 (lattice as learned semantic component)
- Explored: perspectival abstraction, attention topology, lattice specialist model

## Open Questions (from HEAD 012)
1. Training objective for lattice specialist: what loss function captures "good relational structure"?
2. Integration with optical tokens: how does lattice topology actually shape attention gradients?
3. Perspectival abstraction: store multiple orderings, or compute dynamically?
4. Grounding verification: can a model detect when a HEAD is drifting?
5. Bootstrap problem: how to train lattice specialist before you have much lattice data?

## For Next Session
- **Parallel tracks**: Continue prototyping while developing theory
- **Practical**: Case study comparing lattice-guided vs vanilla RAG
- **Theoretical**: Specify lattice specialist training approach
- Open: How do other humans enter? (HEAD 006)

## Context Pressure Level
Low - lattice persists, vision clarifying from tactical through strategic to architectural
