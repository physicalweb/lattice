## Active Thread: Research Consolidation — Multi-Model Analysis

### What Happened This Session

1. **HEAD 019 crystallized: Technical Stack Blueprint**
   - Gemini Deep Research analysis synthesized
   - HippoRAG PPR identified as navigation algorithm for Layer 2
   - AIF (Argument Interchange Format) for contestation schema
   - "Bifurcation Tool" pattern: detect conflict → create two HEADs + `:contested_by`
   - Self-evolving memory (GraphMem) as crystallization mechanism
   - Key insight: "Components exist; orchestrate, don't invent"

2. **Gemini Report Diagrams Reviewed**
   - Page 3: Architectural Divergence (Consensus vs Contestation stacks)
   - Page 7: Lattice Router Architecture (NCP pattern)
   - Page 10: Consensus vs Contestation visual (NotebookLM smoothing vs Agora preserving)
   - Page 13: RAPTOR vs HippoRAG (hierarchical tree vs associative mesh)
   - Page 17: Hybrid Lattice Architecture Blueprint (3-layer stack)

3. **Industry Bifurcation Confirmed**
   - Compression & Consensus (NotebookLM, GraphRAG)
   - Context & Contestation (Agora) ← our differentiator

## Concrete Stack from HEAD 019

| Layer | Component | Tool |
|-------|-----------|------|
| 3 (Router) | Intent-based orchestration | NCP |
| 2 (Lattice) | Graph storage | Neo4j via mcp-neo4j |
| 2 (Navigation) | Semantic traversal | HippoRAG (PPR) |
| 1 (Vector) | Embedding storage | Zilliz/Milvus |
| 1 (Structure) | Hierarchical summaries | RAPTOR |
| 1 (Provenance) | Citations | Zotero MCP |

## Lattice State

- **19 HEADs crystallized** (001-019)
- HEAD 019 extends: 010, 013, 014, 015, 017, 018
- Research consolidation in progress

---

## Next Steps

- Review ChatGPT research (2 MD files in project)
- Compare/contrast with Gemini findings
- Identify convergence and divergence across models
- Consider HEAD 020 for consolidated research synthesis

---

## For Next Session

- Complete multi-model research consolidation
- Map specific implementation priorities
- Consider prototype scope (NCP + Neo4j + HippoRAG minimum viable)
