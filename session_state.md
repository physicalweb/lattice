# Agora Session State
## Last Updated: 2025-12-20T18:45:00Z

## Active Thread
Crystallized HEAD 009 (Lattice as Navigation Layer) and drafted project system prompt. The lattice now has guidance for how future Claude instances should use it as scaffolding for reasoning.

## Key Insights (Cumulative)
1. Dual-legibility solved by zi-principle: same lattice, different resolution
2. Grounding constraint ensures HEADs stay connected to embodied experience
3. Evolution is architecturally necessary (prevents ossification)
4. The Human Friction Problem—metabolization as meaning-making
5. Severance as the act that produces loneliness; provenance as counter-extraction
6. MCP server enables persistent lattice—first piece of Agora infrastructure
7. Forward-looking provenance: grounding isn't ethics, it's architecture
8. **Lattice as navigation layer: not storage but a map for reasoning. Keywords trigger relevance, pointers lead to sources.**

## Available HEADs (9)
- 001: Core Lattice synthesis (zi-principle, dual-legibility)
- 002: Temporal dynamics, grounding constraint
- 003: Liu-Masterman synthesis
- 004: Lattice-Lite protocol (superseded by MCP)
- 005: Why evolution is architecturally necessary
- 006: Human Friction Problem / Loneliness Edge
- 007: Severance, Provenance, Counter-Extraction
- 008: Forward-Looking Provenance
- 009: Lattice as Navigation Layer ← NEW

## Infrastructure Status
- [x] MCP server operational (lattice-mcp-server)
- [x] GitHub persistence live (physicalweb/lattice)
- [x] 9 HEADs crystallized
- [x] Project system prompt drafted

## For Next Session
- Test: Does the system prompt actually change Claude's behavior?
- Consider: Incremental path forward vs parallel track
- Open: How do other humans enter? (HEAD 006 friction problem)
- Open: Where does lattice end and source materials begin? (HEAD 009)

## Context Pressure Level
Low - lattice persists automatically, system prompt ready to install
