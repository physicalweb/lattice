# Agora Session State
## Last Updated: 2025-12-20T17:30:00Z

## Active Thread
MCP server operational. Lattice now persists to GitHub automatically. No more manual download/upload cycle.

## Key Insights (Cumulative)
1. Dual-legibility solved by zi-principle: same lattice, different resolution
2. Grounding constraint ensures HEADs stay connected to embodied experience
3. Evolution is architecturally necessary (prevents ossification)
4. The Human Friction Problem—metabolization as meaning-making
5. **Severance as the act that produces loneliness; provenance as counter-extraction**
6. **MCP server enables persistent lattice—first piece of Agora infrastructure**

## Available HEADs
- 001: Core Lattice synthesis (zi-principle, dual-legibility)
- 002: Temporal dynamics, grounding constraint
- 003: Liu-Masterman synthesis
- 004: Lattice-Lite protocol (now superseded by MCP)
- 005: Why evolution is architecturally necessary
- 006: Human Friction Problem / Loneliness Edge
- 007: Severance, Provenance, Counter-Extraction

## Infrastructure Status
- [x] Lattice-lite skill (local operations)
- [x] MCP server (lattice-mcp-server)
- [x] GitHub persistence (physicalweb/lattice)
- [x] ngrok tunnel for claude.ai access
- [ ] Deployed MCP server (currently local)

## Open Questions
1. Deploy MCP server permanently (Cloudflare Workers? Vercel?)
2. How does provenance heal vs. build a bridge over the wound?
3. What is Agora selling if healing IS the business model?

## Context Pressure Level
Low - lattice now persists automatically

## Next Actions
- Consider permanent deployment of MCP server
- Update lattice-lite skill to use MCP instead of local files
- Continue developing counter-extraction framing
