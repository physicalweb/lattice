## Active Thread: Semantic Space and Projective Views

### What Happened This Session

1. HEAD 015 crystallized (retrieval as grounding)
2. Project prompt v2 deployed
3. Persona seed captured
4. Document lifecycle discussion
5. **HEAD 016 crystallized: Lattice as Semantic Space with Projective Views**

---

## HEAD 016 Core Insight

The lattice isn't layers (navigation above, sources below). It's a **navigable semantic space** where HEADs and sources coexist.

**Views are projections** of this space for different purposes:
- Theory depth view
- Product coherence view
- External share view
- Research handoff view (e.g., for Gemini)
- Navigation view (live reasoning)

This echoes "language in use"—meaning is context-dependent, actualized by the view being projected.

**Snapshot = view rendered at a moment**, which can then be frozen and become source material.

---

## Document Lifecycle Model (Refined)

### States

**FROZEN**: External sources, past published work, historical reference
**LIVE**: Current working docs, spawned revisions

### Spatial Model (replaces "layers")

```
        SEMANTIC SPACE
    (HEADs + sources + edges)
              │
    ┌─────────┼─────────┐
    ▼         ▼         ▼
 [VIEW 1] [VIEW 2] [VIEW 3]
    │
    ▼
 Rendered → Frozen → Becomes source
```

## Ingestion Types

| Source Type | Lens |
|-------------|------|
| Tech advancement | What changes? What's obsolete? |
| Competitor/product | Their theory? Our difference? |
| Philosophy/social science | New concepts? Extends/contests? |
| Implementation patterns | Best practices? |

---

## Aspects as Query Dimensions

HEADs carry aspect tags: `theory`, `concept`, `feature`

Views can filter by aspect:
- "Show all theory-level HEADs"
- "What features emerged from HEAD 007?"

---

## Seeds (Not Yet Crystallized)

### Seed 1: Persona as Counter-Mimicry
LLMs mimic domain/register. Persona provides stable orientation. Taylor's "Strong Evaluator" = deep frameworks grounding identity.

---

## Key Insights (Cumulative)
1-15: [see HEADs]
16. **Lattice as semantic space with projective views** (HEAD 016)

---

## Lattice State
- **16 HEADs crystallized** (001-016)
- **1 seed** awaiting crystallization (persona)
- HEAD 016 grounded in: 001, 009, 013, 015

## Open Questions
- View definitions: What exactly constitutes each view type?
- Aspect taxonomy: Is theory/concept/feature sufficient?
- View tooling: How to actually project and render views?
- Cross-view coherence: How to keep views aligned?

## For Next Session
- Define specific views and their specs?
- Implement a view as proof of concept?
- Crystallize persona seed?
